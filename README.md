# Bonext üçΩÔ∏è

This is **the** Next.js boilerplate I use for the most of my projects. It contains the following conventions/features:

- Fully written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Component Libary with [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- Integration with [NextSeo](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo)

## Getting Started

Change `site.config.ts` with the project that is being made

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
